// Over the break as I was studying I went through the old homeworks. I had missed your comments and realized that I didnt submit part of (or in some cases all) of the assignments. This Semester is the first time that I am using Github and initially I didnt realize that I had to commit changes. I have gone through and updated/completed them and attached them here in hopes that I can potentially get some points for the work.
